        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Before becoming a web developer, I graduated with my Bachelors in Biology at the University of Minnesota-Duluth. After graduating
            I worked as a behavioral therapist for with young kids. After a while, I wanted something more challenging and got into coding.
            I fell in love with the problem solving and building websites from the ground up. 

            When I'm not coding, I love reading, running, and hanging out with my friends and family. 
            I love to travel and will always search out the best coffee and bookstores wherever I go. I 
            also enjoy making youtube videos on the side.

            <h3>Stationery Website</h3>
            <p>
                It's been a goal of mine to start my own stationery business so I created a user friendly website using CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Epress, Node.js, and Axios. 
                Users are able to add items to their cart, sign-up/log-in, and click the logo at the top of the page
                to get back to the homepage. The naviagtion bar at the top changes colors and reveals a dropdown menu when Users
                hover it.
